Overview
The first institute of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology was established in 2007. The aim and objective of the institute is to promote and provide facilities for post graduate study in ICT for graduates from various disciplines and to actively pursue research in ICT in order to develop knowledge based products and services. The institute will also develop ICT facilities in order to create an on-campus environment conductive to enthusiasm, innovation, and enterprise and to nurture innovative ideas and incubate promising initiatives. In the same time institute will try to produce manpower and expertise in ICT by carrying out training in diverse areas for those interested in taking ICT as a profession as well as those already engaged in the profession. The institute will also provide consulting and advisory services to public and private organizations.

Post Graduate Diploma in Information Technology
 

Total Credit : 36
Course Length : 18 Months
Total Terms : 3
 

Examination System:
       A student will be evaluated continuously throughout the whole term. For theoretical courses s/he will be assessed by class participation, assignments, quizzes and final examinations. A two-hour (50 marks) final examination will be conducted for every theory course. For laboratory course s/he will be assessed by observation at work, viva-voce during laboratory works, from his/her written reports and lab final examination. A course result will be produced by combining theory and lab part according to the respective theory and lab credit.

 

Grading System:
       Letter Grade and corresponding Grade-Point for a course will be awarded from the roundup marks of individual courses as follows:

Numerical Grade

Letter Grade

Grade Point

80% and above

C-

2.00

Less than 40%                                

F

0.00

 

Calculation of Grades:
       GPA:  Grade Point Average (GPA) is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses completed by a student in a term.

          CGPA:  Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) will be calculated by the weighted average of every courses of previous term along with the present term.

          F Grades:  A student is given an ‘F’ grade if he fails or is absent in the final examination of a course. If a student obtains an ‘F’ grade his grade will not be counted for GPA and s/he has to repeat the course.
